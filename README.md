# SIR Model Jupyter Notebooks

The most informative notebook here is <explore_r0.ipynb>

To run these yourself, you'll need Python 3.6.7 (other versions of Python 3.6+
will probably work, just change `.python-version`) and pip.  You should be able
to do the following:

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```

This should open Jupyer Lab in your browser.
